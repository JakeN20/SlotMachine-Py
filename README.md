# SlotMachine-Py
Short python program to simulate a slot machine

This python code is a mock-up of a 3 row, 3 column slot machine that I created for a lab to help supplement my learning

How it works:

- Upon executing the program, it will ask the user for an input of how much money they want to deposit.

- It will then tell you your current balance with an input asking if you would like to play.

- User will input the number of lines they wish to bet on. (1-3) As well as the amount of money they wish to bet for each of those lines. ($1-$100)

- The output will then show the result of the slot roll, which lines you won on (if any), how much money you won and your new balance.
